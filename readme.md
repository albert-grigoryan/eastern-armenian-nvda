# Eastern Armenian Voices NVDA

This is a modified version of the [Sonata Neural Voices](https://github.com/mush42/sonata-nvda) add-on for the Eastern Armenian.

This add-on implements a speech synthesizer driver for NVDA using neural TTS models. It supports [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper). This add-on uses [Sonata: A cross-platform Rust engine for neural TTS models](https://github.com/albert-grigoryan/sonata) which is being developed by Musharraf Omer.
